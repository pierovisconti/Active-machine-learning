# Active-machine-learning
R scripts to simulate different species distributions, simulate different sampling strategies
and use the simulated samples to re-predict the distributions.
Active machine learning methods such as uncertainty sampling and maximum entropy sampling are also applied
the SDMs include maxent, gaussian random fields, logistic regression and classification trees.
the performance of different sampling methods is evaluated through curves of AUC and TSS of the models
with increasing sample size. everything else equal (species dataset, number of points sampled, SDM, active learning
sampling techniques are expected and observed to perform better than standard techniques e.g. stratified sampling and 
systematic sampling).
